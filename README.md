# tensorflowjs-demo
I am seeing the #TFDevSummit 2020 video. whenever I move my face while watching the video that video frames also will move as per my face movement. I am really excited to implement this small application.

I have used the #tensorflowjs blaze face model to track our face and show the videos on the face. it will be very useful to see the videos.
